*** \brief Represents an OpenAL source
***
*** OpenAL is designed to take care of the complexity of panning sound to
*** different speakers; it does this by storing the locations in 3d space of
*** both the physical sources that a sound might originate from (for example,
*** the point in space where two swords clang together), and also the 3d
*** location of the listener's "ears". A source in OpenAL is simply metadata
*** about the position of the sound; the actual sound itself comes from audio
*** data which is loaded into a buffer, and then played back through one of
*** these sources.
***
*** This metadata includes properties like position, velocity,
*** etc. None of these are actually altered by OpenAL; OpenAL does not use
*** velocity to move the sound sources for us each game tick; rather, it simply
*** uses these to calculate sound itself (velocity is actually used for
*** calculating doppler effects). We are expected to fill these values with
*** appropriate position/velocity data to keep them in sync with the game
*** objects they represent.
***
*** Those properties are not managed by this class, but rather by the
*** AudioDescriptor to which the source is attached. OpenAL (or rather, the
*** audio hardware) only allows a limited number of audio sources to exist at
*** one time, so we can't create a source for every piece of audio that is
*** loaded by the game. Therefore, we create as many sources as we can (up to
*** MAX_DEFAULT_AUDIO_SOURCES) and have the audio descriptors share between
*** sources as they need them.
***
*** \note OpenAL sources are created and by the AudioEngine class, not within the
*** AudioSource constructor. The sources are, however, deleted by the destructor.
***
*** \note You should never really need to call the IsValid() function when
*** retrieving a new AudioSource to use. This is because all AudioSource objects
*** created by AudioEngine are guaranteed to have a valid OpenAL source contained
*** by the object.
